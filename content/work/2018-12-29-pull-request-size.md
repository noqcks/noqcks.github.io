I created [Pull Request Size](https://github.com/noqcks/pull-request-size). It's a GitHub app that you can install from [here](https://github.com/apps/pull-request-size). It will tell you how
large your Pull Requests are based on the lines of code changed.

This is almost entirely borrowed from how [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) sizes their pull request, and it's where I originally had the idea. I just managed to turn it into a GitHub application that anyone can install and use. You can find the Privacy Policy for the GitHub application [here](https://github.com/noqcks/pull-request-size/blob/master/PRIVACY.md).

I've found that it's a helpful reminder to always keep Pull Requests as small as
possible! I think we know this scenario all too well.
