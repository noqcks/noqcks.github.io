I've been looking for a simple way to handle my servers with a centralized management tool for a long time. I've tried Chef, Puppet, Salt, and Ansible, and finally I chose Ansible, here's why:

- YAML-based syntax and configuration templates, really easy to set up and get running
- No slaves (agents) requred on managed servers

I'm not a pro DevOps or a "full-stack" engineer, so I only need a tool like that that can help me update / install programs, update Nginx configurations, and do other repetitive work. Ansible seems to fit the bill.

If you have never tried Ansible and don't know what can be done with it, check out [my first Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/sparanoid/ansible-shadowsocks).
