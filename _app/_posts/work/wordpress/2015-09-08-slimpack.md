Slimpack — Lightweight Jetpack. Super-fast performance without modules that require contracting WordPress.com.

It provides better performance than original Jetpack. All features that require a WordPress.com account or need contracting / syncing back to WordPress.com servers have been removed. You don't need to connect to WordPress.com to use this plugin. If your site got slow response time (TTFB) after activating the original Jetpack, you should definitely try out this plugin.

### Features

- Transfer from Jetpack to Slimpack seamlessly, just deactivate Jetpack and activate Slimpack, all settings and module status will be kept and work just like before.
- All source code is untouched and synced from Jetpack
- Better performance than original Jetpack. All features that require a WordPress.com account have been removed. You don't need to connect to WordPress.com to use this plugin.
- Multilingual support (and languages have already bundled in Slimpack!)
