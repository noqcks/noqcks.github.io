I'm a DevOps engineer currently residing in Toronto, Canada. My current interests
are focused around container technology and kernel hacking.

I currently work at Iron.io where [we run a lot of Docker containers](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3112875/application-development/lessons-from-launching-billions-of-docker-containers.html).

You can shoot me an email at [benny@noqcks.io](mailto:benny@noqcks.io) or hit me
